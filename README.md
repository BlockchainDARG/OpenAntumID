BitID implementation in PHP
===========================

PHP implementation of [BitID project/draft](https://github.com/bitid/bitid).

Based on the work of [scintill/php-bitcoin-signature-routines](https://github.com/scintill/php-bitcoin-signature-routines) and using [PHPECC classes](https://github.com/mdanter/phpecc)

*Bitcoin Authentication Open Protocol*

Pure Bitcoin sites and applications shouldnâ€™t have to rely on artificial identification methods such as usernames and passwords. BitID is an open protocol allowing simple and secure authentication using public-key cryptography.

Classical password authentication is an insecure process that could be solved with public key cryptography. The problem however is that it theoretically offloads a lot of complexity and responsibility on the user. Managing private keys securely is complex. However this complexity is already being addressed in the Bitcoin ecosystem. So doing public key authentication is practically a free lunch to bitcoiners.

**The protocol is described on the following BIP draft and is open for discussion :**
