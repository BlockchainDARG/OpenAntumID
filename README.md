BitID implementation in PHP
===========================

PHP implementation of [BitID project/draft](https://github.com/bitid/bitid).

Based on the work of [scintill/php-bitcoin-signature-routines](https://github.com/scintill/php-bitcoin-signature-routines) and using [PHPECC classes](https://github.com/mdanter/phpecc)

**Bitcoin Authentication Open Protocol**

Pure Bitcoin sites and applications shouldnâ€™t have to rely on artificial identification methods such as usernames and passwords. BitID is an open protocol allowing simple and secure authentication using public-key cryptography.

Classical password authentication is an insecure process that could be solved with public key cryptography. The problem however is that it theoretically offloads a lot of complexity and responsibility on the user. Managing private keys securely is complex. However this complexity is already being addressed in the Bitcoin ecosystem. So doing public key authentication is practically a free lunch to bitcoiners.

**The protocol is described on the following BIP draft and is open for discussion :**

Installation
============
* Create a MySQL database, import struct.sql into it.
* Configure database information in DAO.php
* Configure server's url in index.php


Notes
=====
* I tried to create a flexible library, some  work needs to be done to adapt it to your project

* Pure PHP implementation, no need of **bitcoind**

* GMP PHP extension is required

* **isMessageSignatureValidSafe** is the same function as **isMessageSignatureValid** but the later with throw different exceptions on fail, while the former only return true/false

* By default, it will only 1 user by ip to **try** login at the same time (once a user is logged, another user could start the login process), this example could be modify to allow several (no need to modify BitID)
